Welcome to the global portal for documentation, news, and other information about the **Systems Biology Graphical Notation** (SBGN) project, an effort to standardize the graphical notation used in maps of biological processes.

## Quick start

## Example Pathway

This pathway is an SBGN-PD diagram based on the following paper published in the October 2014 issue of the Cell magazine (PubMed ID: [25303525](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25303525)).

*Ma H, Groth RD, Cohen SM, Emery JF, Li B, Hoedt E, Zhang G, Neubert TA, Tsien RW. (2014) γCaMKII shuttles Ca²⁺/CaM to the nucleus to trigger CREB phosphorylation and gene expression. [Cell 159,281-294](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867414011684).*

SBGN is the work of many people. It would not have been possible without the generous [support of multiple organizations](/docs/ ) over the years, for which we are very thankful.
