# Specifications

There are three orthogonal and complementary visual languages defined in SBGN: Process Description (PD), Entity Relationship (ER), and Activity Flow (AF). They can be seen as three alternative projections of the underlying, more complex biological information.

### Process Description language

The SBGN *Process Description* (PD) language shows the temporal courses of biochemical interactions in a network. It can be used to show all the molecular interactions taking place in a network of biochemical entities, with the same entity appearing multiple times in the same diagram.

#### Current Specification:

The **SBGN PD language Level 1 Version 1.3** --Available at ***Journal of Integrative Bioinformatics***, [2015 Sep 4;12(2):263 (doi: 10.2390/biecoll-jib-2015-263)](http://journal.imbio.de/article.php?aid=263).




### Entity Relationship language

The SBGN *Entity Relationship* (ER) language allows you to see all the relationships in which a given entity participates, regardless of the temporal aspects. Relationships can be seen as rules describing the influences of entities nodes on other relationships.

#### Current Specification:

The **SBGN ER language Level 1 Version 2.0** -- Available at ***Journal of Integrative Bioinformatics***, [2015 Sep 4;12(2):264 (doi:10.2390/biecoll-jib-2015-264)](http://journal.imbio.de/article.php?aid=264).


### Activity Flow language

The SBGN *Activity Flow* (AF) language depicts the flow of information between biochemical entities in a network. It omits information about the state transitions of entities and is particularly convenient for representing the effects of perturbations, whether genetic or environmental in nature.

#### Current Specification:
The **SBGN AF language Level 1 Version 1.2** -- Available at ***Journal of Integrative Bioinformatics***,  [2015 Sep 4;12(2):265. (doi:10.2390/biecoll-jib-2015-265)](http://journal.imbio.de/article.php?aid=265)
