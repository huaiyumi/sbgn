Repressilator
--------------

The repressilator is a circular system of three genes which products sequentially inhibit the expression of the next gene. Both the model and its in vitro realization were published by [Michael Elowitz and Stanislas Leibler in 2000](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10659856), in a publication that is seen as one of the milestones in the birth of Synthetic Biology.

EGFR signaling
--------------

This is a representation in AF of the signaling pathways triggered by EGF binding on its receptor. The original information came from [STKE](http://stke.sciencemag.org/cgi/cm/stkecm;CMP_14987), and a first version of the image was published in [the initial SBGN publication](http://identifiers.org/pubmed/19668183).
