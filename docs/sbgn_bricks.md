# SBGN bricks

SBGN bricks are defined as the recurring biological paterns reflected in the SBGN languages (Junker et al., 2012, <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tibtech.2012.08.003">doi:10.1016/j.tibtech.2012.08.003</a>). SBGN bricks present a tamplate-based approach that allows users to simplify learning SBGN and to start applying it without needing to read all the specifications. The <a href="http://sbgnbricks.sourceforge.net/sbgnbricks_dictionary.html">dictionary of SBGN bricks</a> aligns biological concepts with their graphical expressions in SBGN languages.

      <td><strong>Irreversible metabolic reaction</strong> with one substrate and one product. The enzyme catalyzes an irreversible metabolic process which consumes substrate S1 and produces product P1. The enzyme is a protein, therefore represented as a <i>macromolecule</i>. Substrate and product of the biochemical reaction are represented by <i>simple chemicals</i>.</td>
