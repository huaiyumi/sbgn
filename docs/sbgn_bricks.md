      <td><strong>Irreversible reaction with 1 substrate and 1 product</strong><br />
The enzyme catalyzes an irreversible (metabolic) process which consumes the substrate (S1) and produces the product (P1). The enzyme is a protein, therefore represented as a ‘macromolecule’. Substrate and product of the biochemical reaction are represented by ‘simple chemicals’. The consumption of S1 is represented by the consumption arc. The production arc represents the synthesis of P1.</td>
