| ![PD_catalysis_irr_1_1](/sbgn/images/bricks/PD_catalysis_irr_1_1.png) | Irreversible reaction with 1 substrate and 1 product
The enzyme catalyzes an irreversible (metabolic) process which consumes the substrate (S1) and produces the product (P1). The enzyme is a protein, therefore represented as a ‘macromolecule’. Substrate and product of the biochemical reaction are represented by ‘simple chemicals’. The consumption of S1 is represented by the consumption arc. The production arc represents the synthesis of P1. |
