# Learning SBGN

<p>This is a brief introduction in the SBGN languages, and, in particular, we will focus on the Process Description language as the most used language of the SBGN standard. There are 3 languages in SBGN: Activity Flow, Process Description and Entity Relation.</p>

The same biological events are shown in different representations depending on the concepts used to describe them (adapted from Le Novère, 2015, [doi:10.1038/nrg3885](https://dx.doi.org/10.1038/nrg3885)).

## Process in SBGN Process Description

<p>For a better understanding of the Process Description language it is important to focus on the process glyphs on the diagrams:</p>

<p>Represented in Process Description, biological process includes 1) incoming consumption link(s) to the process, 2) production link(s) from the process, and often 3) regulatory link(s) to the process, for example stimulation or inhibition.</p>

## SBGN PD dictionary

<p>Here are some illustrations of how biological concepts such as metabolic reaction or complex formation are reflected in the SBGN Process Description language (Junker et al., 2012, <a href="https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tibtech.2012.08.003">doi:10.1016/j.tibtech.2012.08.003</a>.</p>
