## Events

*  [SBGN Events](#sbgn-events)
*  [COMBINE Events](#combine-events)

As part of our efforts to develop and establish SBGN, in 2006 we initiated a workshop series to bring together individuals from around the world who are interested in discussing SBGN, its implementation and its evolution.

This page provides access to meeting pages, agendas, and other information about upcoming as well as past events.
