Information about regular COMBINE and HARMONY meetings is available on the [COMBINE Events](http://co.mbine.org/events) page. SBGN workshops are organised as part of these meetings. The ‘COmputational Modeling in BIology’ NEtwork (COMBINE) is an initiative to coordinate the development of the various community standards and formats for computational models, initially in Systems Biology and related fields.
